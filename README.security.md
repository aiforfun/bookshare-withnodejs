# One-way password encryption: Hashes and salts
- The thing to do here is run a one-way encryption on the password. One-way encryp- tion prevents anyone from decrypting the password, while still making it quite easy to validate a correct password. When users try to log in, the application can encrypt a given password and see if it matches the stored value.
- Just encrypting isn’t quite enough, though. If several people used the word “pass- word” as their password (it happens!) then the encryption for each will be the same. Any hackers looking through the database could see this pattern and identify poten- tially weak passwords.
This is where the concept of a salt comes in. A salt is a random string generated by the application for each user that’s combined with the password before encryption.


# Generate a JWT
- KEEPING THE SECRET SECRET WITH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
- If you’re going to be pushing your code around in version control, like GitHub for example, you don’t want to have the secret published. Exposing your secret dramati- cally weakens your security model—with your secret anybody could issue fake tokens that your application believes to be genuine. To keep secrets a secret, it’s often a good idea to set them as environment variables.
- Here’s an easy way to do it, that lets you keep track of environment variables in the code on your machine. First create a file in the root of the project called .env, and set the secret as follows:
- JWT_SECRET=thisIsSecret
